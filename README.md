### Abstract

Digital Product Passports (DPPs) are a recent European Union (EU) initiative aimed at improving product 
traceability, transparency, and sustainability to facilitate the circular economy. DPPs contain lifecycle data that 
have the potential to reduce fragmented data in Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) systems. However, the 
integration of DPPs presents challenges for existing technical infrastructures, often requiring system 
development or adaptation. This study presents an ontology-driven integration framework to incorporate DPP 
data into EAM systems. The research combines literature review, survey and interviews to identify integration 
challenges and requirements. A modular ontology was developed to formally represent DPP information. 
Building upon this ontology as the foundational layer, a semantic integration architecture was designed to guide 
the implementation of a system that uses a triple store and REST APIs to connect the EAM system with DPP 
data repositories. The resulting DPP ontology was populated with sample data to demonstrate and validate the 
integration approach. Findings indicate that the proposed integration is well supported for its ability to reduce 
fragmented data, asset traceability, regulatory compliance while meeting industry requirements. The study 
provides the first sematic bridge between DPP and EAM systems, enabling organizations to leverage product 
lifecycle data, for more informed decision-making, while simultaneously laying a foundation for sustainable 
asset management practices.
